# Overview

Requriements included building a simple website with both bootstrap and custom CSS styling as well as incorporating a grade calculator with Javascript to the program (grade calculations were based off weighted factors of current IS course).
# Description
Specific changes include adding a navigation bar, separating the grade calculator into its own page, and using javascript to display the final calculated grade message.
